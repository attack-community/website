# Ninth EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop 2 June 2022

The ninth EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place on 2 June 2022 from 10am CET until 5pm. We will organize this event in hybrid format, with space for some 200 attendees in a conference room in Brussels and the other attendees joining virtually.

Those of you who join us in Brussels will have the opportunity to meet the MITRE ATT&CK and Engenuity teams as well as the core community contributors in person. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss and interact with them.
