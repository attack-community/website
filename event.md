# Ninth EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop 2 June 2022

The ninth EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place on 2 June 2022 from 9am CET until 6pm. We will organize this event in hybrid format, with space for some 200 attendees in a conference room in Brussels and the other attendees joining virtually.

Those of you who join us in Brussels will have the opportunity to meet the MITRE ATT&CK and Engenuity teams as well as the core community contributors in person. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss and interact with them. 

We will continue the highly-effective format of short (15’) lightning talks, focusing on the following themes: 
1.	Tools and methods for sharing 
2.	Rules, playbooks and processes 
3.	ATT&CK flavors (cloud, telecom, ICS, Active Defense…)

You will hear presentations by Jamie Williams on ATT&CK V11, Ingrid Skoog on ATT&CK Flow and the Top ATT&CK Techniques, Thomas Patzke on pySigma and many more. The detailed agenda will be published on this page in the coming weeks.

It would be highly appreciated if you would be willing to share your experience with the ATT&CK® Framework in any of the three domains in a 15’ lightning talk. Presentation by user organisations are particularly appreciated. We would like to point out that presentations should focus on practical insights and contributions that the community can put into practice. Tools and methods presented should therefore be accessible and deployable by the participants. Commercial content in the presentations will not be accepted. 

Participation to this event is at no cost, but registration is required on the following link (EU Commission registration system):

The workshop is hosted by CERT-EU and supported by CIRCL and the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense. It is organized by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response.
