# Seventh EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop

The seventh EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place, in virtual format, on 1-2 June 2021 from 2pm CET until 6pm CET. The workshop is supported by CERT-EU, CIRCL and the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense. It is organized by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response. 

You will hear updates from MITRE and from developers of systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK® Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community. Here is the draft agenda:

We plan a breakout sesssion on SIGMA and datamodels, in which you will be able to interact with the leading community experts. The breakout session is planned after the coffee break on the first day.

We will launch the alpha version of CyCAT (https://cycat.org/) at the workshop. We would very much welcome presentations from the community on existing repositories that could be included in CyCAT. There will also be a hand-on session on CyCAT at the end of the first day. 

There are still speaking slots available and it would be highly appreciated if you would be willing to share your experience with the ATT&CK® Framework in a 15’ lightning talk. We also welcome short (5’) presentations of an unresolved problem in your environment: “I have a problem, does the community have a solution?”. Presentations should focus on practical insights and contributions that the community can put into practice. Tools and methods presented should therefore be accessible and deployable by the participants. Commercial content in the presentations will not be accepted. 

Participation to this event is at no cost, but registration is required. We insist that you provide your real name, affiliation and a corporate email address in your registration. You can register on the following link:
