# Twelfth EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop 17 May 2024

The twelfth EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place on 17 May 2024 from 9am CET until 6pm. We will organize this event in hybrid format, with space for some 300 attendees in a conference room in Brussels and the other attendees joining virtually.  The workshop is hosted by the <a href="https://ccb.belgium.be/en"> Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium </a>  and supported by the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense. 

It is organized by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response. 
You will hear updates from MITRE and from the developers of systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK® Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community.
