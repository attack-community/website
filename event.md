# EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop – Save the date!

The 2025 EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place, in hybrid format, on 15 May 2025 from 9am CET until 5pm CET, hosted by the <a href="https://ccb.belgium.be/en"> Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium </a>  and supported by the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense.  It is organized by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response.

You will hear updates from MITRE, the Center for Threat-Informed Defense and from the developers of systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK® Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community.
