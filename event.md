# EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop - 26 May 2023

The next EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop will be organised in hybrid format (in-person in Brussels as well as via videoconference) on Friday 26 May 2023. It will be hosted by the <a href="https://ccb.belgium.be/en"> Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium</a>. 

The workshop is organized by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response. You will hear updates from MITRE/Engenuity and from the developers of systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK® Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community. 

We will continue the highly-effective format of short (15’) lightning talks, focusing on the following themes: 
1.	Tools and methods for sharing 
2.	Rules, playbooks and processes 
3.	ATT&CK flavors (cloud, telecom, ICS, Active Defense…)

It would be highly appreciated if you would be willing to share your experience with the ATT&CK® Framework in any of the three domains in a 15’ lightning talk. Presentation by user organisations are particularly appreciated. We would like to point out that presentations should focus on practical insights and contributions that the community can put into practice. Tools and methods presented should therefore be accessible and deployable by the participants. Commercial content in the presentations will not be accepted.
