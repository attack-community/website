# Seventh EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop

The seventh EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place, in virtual format, on 1-2 June 2021 from 2pm CET until 6pm CET. The workshop is supported by CERT-EU, CIRCL and the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense. It is organized by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response. 

You will hear updates from MITRE and from the developers of systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK® Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community. 

We will continue the highly-effective format of short (15’) lightning talks, focusing on the following themes: 
1.	Tools and methods for sharing (CyCAT, SIGMA, MISP…)
2.	Rules, playbooks and processes (content, telemetry for validation)
3.	ATT&CK flavors (cloud, telecom, ICS, Active Defense…)

We intend to launch the alpha version of CyCAT (https://cycat.org/) at the workshop. We would very much welcome presentations from the community on existing repositories that are planned to be submitted to CyCAT for inclusion and the expectations of the authors. There will also be a hand-on session on CyCAT at the end of the first day. 
It would be highly appreciated if you would be willing to share your experience with the ATT&CK® Framework in any of the three domains in a 15’ lightning talk. We would also welcome short (5’) presentations of an unresolved problem in your environment: “I have a problem, does the community have a solution?” 

We would like to point out that the presentations should focus on practical insights and contributions that the community can put into practice. Tools and methods presented should therefore be accessible and deployable by the participants. Commercial content in the presentations will not be accepted. 

Participation to this event is at no cost for the participants, but registration is required. We insist that you provide your real name, affiliation and a corporate email address in your registration.
