subtitle: The background story
---

The EU ATT&CK Community is a diverse community of cybersecurity practitioners including researchers, vendors, CSIRTs/CERTs and user organisations whose aim is to actively use MITRE ATT&CK™ while contributing back to improve cyber defense. The EU ATT&CK Community is a vendor neutral platform where all participants can discuss, exchange and improve their use of adversary tactics and techniques together in practical use cases like attribution, prevention, detection, hunting and response.

The EU ATT&CK Community was set up in agreement with MITRE but it is not operated by MITRE and the content of these webpages are not specifically endorsed by MITRE. More information about MITRE ATT&CK™ can be found at <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/"> MITRE ATT&CK™</a> and <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/"> MITRE Engenuity</a>.

# History

On 24-25 May 2018, over 40 cybersecurity professionals met at C3 (the Cybersecurity Competence Center) in Luxembourg to discuss how MITRE ATT&CK™ can help strengthen cyber defense. The participants came from over 30 different organizations, ranging from national CERTs to financial sector organizations to cybersecurity vendors. Despite their differences in country of origin, sector, and background, attendees came together with a common goal of sharing how MITRE ATT&CK™ can be used in practice. The group found value about hearing each other’s use cases and thought it would be valuable to continue the conversation. Since then EU ATT&CK workshops have been organised twice a year.
